## Details

The project started with a few hundred bacteria species that were manually
curated by Nitin K Singh. Nishka Arora later joined the project to create a
Python package, working with Ashish Mahabal and Nitin K Singh.

This Streamlit site was developed by Ashish Mahabal as part of a small TRISH
project titled "Quantifying Human Related Microbial Pathogenicity from Space
Flight Data" (PIs: S G Djorgovski, A Mahabal). Some of the background analysis
was done by Sanskriti Shindadkar, and Progyan Das.

We will continue to add details in connection with antibiotics and the human angle.
