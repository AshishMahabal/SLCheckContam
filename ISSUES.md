# Known Issues

This section outlines the current known issues with the Contamination Checker
application. We are actively working on resolving these issues and appreciate
your patience.

## Issue 1: Species with ambiguous values not in results

- Details: When the input CSV contains species with ambiguous values in the
curated list (e.g., value for radiation resistance") we currently do not include
them in the results.

## Issue 2: Results from semi-curated list will indicate lower limits

- Details: The semi-curated list is missing many values, so results will indicate
lower limits for contamination potential.

## Reporting New Issues

If you encounter any issues not listed here, please report them through contact in
